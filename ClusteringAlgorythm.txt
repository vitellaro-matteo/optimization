Assume every node knows ID of its neighbours
Weight 0 is considedred as the clusterhead

1.  Decide k initially
    (maximum graph distance between the cluster-head (centre of a cluster) and the cluster border)
2.  Every node is assigned a random value from [0,k]
3.  Set my weight to the min_weight of my neighbours
    (this step creates an ordering between neighbouring nodes such that max weight difference between 2 neighbours is 1)
4.  If all my neighbours have weight = k, set my weight to 0
5.  If my weight !=0 AND my weight < all weights of my neighbours, increment my weight by 1
    (Resolves situations where the current UAV is intermediate node to the clusterhead and is not pointing to any clusterhead)
6.  If my weight = 0 AND there exists a neighbour m with weight(m) = 0, then increment my weight by 1
    (if two clusterheads are directly connected with each other, this step resolves this problem)
