# Optimization for Computer Science

## Decentralized Federated Learning for Clustering
Welcome to the project repository for the University of Luxembourg's class in Master in Information and Computer Science, "Optimization for Computer Science."

## About the Project
This project is conducted under the supervision of Lena-Maria Hartmann, a PhD student, and explores the realm of decentralized federated learning. Our primary focus lies in clustering techniques, aiming to investigate and implement decentralized approaches for clustering data.

## Objective
We aim to explore methodologies for cluster analysis, with a particular emphasis on the utilization of k-hop clustering as our initial approach.

## Project Structure
The repository will be structured to accommodate the various components of our research and implementation efforts. This will include:

Code: The codebase will house our implementations, experiments, and evaluations.
Documentation: We will provide detailed documentation, including explanations of algorithms, methodologies, and results.
Data: Any datasets utilized for experimentation and testing purposes will be included here.
Resources: Supplementary materials such as papers, articles, and relevant literature will be organized for reference.
