Assume every node knows ID of its neighbours
Weight 0 is considedred as the clusterhead

1.  Decide k initially
    (maximum graph distance between the cluster-head (centre of a cluster) and the cluster border)
2.  Every node is assigned a random value from [0,k]
3.  Set my weight to the {(max_weight of my neighbours) - 1} if the maximum weight of my neighbours is MIN and my weight is not equal to {(max_weight of my neighbours) - 1}
    (this step creates an ordering between neighbouring nodes such that max weight difference between 2 neighbours is 1)
4.  If all my neighbours have weight = MIN and my weight is also MIN, set my weight to MAX (i.e. value k)
5.  If my weight != MAX AND weight of all my neighbours <= my weight, decrement my weight by 1
    (Resolves situations where the current UAV is intermediate node to the clusterhead and is not pointing to any clusterhead)
6.  If my weight = MAX AND there exists a neighbour m with weight(m) = MAX, then decrement my weight by 1
    (if two clusterheads are directly connected with each other, this step resolves this problem)
